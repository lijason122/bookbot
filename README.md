# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Project Structure

## Usage

Run the main script with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Description

- `main.py`: The main Python script that processes a book text file, counts word frequencies, and outputs statistics.

## Example

To analyze a book file:

```bash
python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```

The script will print the total word count and a breakdown of word frequencies.
